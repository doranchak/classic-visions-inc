<p> <font size=+2>S</font>earching for your ancestors is a fascinating pastime, which I have enjoyed since 1979.  I am constantly amazed at the amount of information our ancestors inadvertently left behind about themselves.  For instance, I recently uncovered the circumstances of the final moments of one ancestor's life.

<p> <font size=+2>I</font>t seems he was in a field, stacking some hay on the morning of Dec 16, 1778, when he was surprised by a small band of Delaware warriors.  First he was wounded by a musket ball, then he was tomahawked, and finally scalped.

<p> <font size=+2>M</font>onths before, a much larger band of Iroquois had had the same opportunity, but had released him, because they knew that he was a Quaker, and that he had always been a friend to them.  The British, upon learning that he had been released, doubled the bounty on his scalp, because he was pro-American and a person to whom many people looked for guidance.

<p> <font size=+2>D</font>o you wonder what happened to your ancestors?  What did they do and what motivated them to do the things they did?  Many times, the information is available.  When researching the lives of ancestors, I try to find out as much as possible about that person, not just about their births and deaths, but facts about their lives which add meat to the bones of your ancestral chart.  Hopefully, there will be enough information about the person you are seeking to enable you to come to know them as you've never known them before.

<p> <font size=+2>M</font>y research centers around the Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware areas, though I have also researched the records of Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia.
