<p>The Indian Heritage Council, has produced a collection of many of the
sayings of spiritual and political leaders in the recorded history of
Native-Americans of all tribes and nations.  In twenty eight chapters
entitled The Great American Indian Bible, this collection not only contains
these timeless words, but it also includes devotions, such as the
Kwaital-Bannock-Shoshoni Indian Prayer, the Sayings of Sage Elk, Cherokee
Medicine Man, advice from Indian elders of today, and other depictions of
Native-American lives, as seen through their eyes.  The Great American Indian
Bible, is offered through Classic Visions, Inc., the only Internet
distributor of this timeless collection.  Believe it or not, the Great
American Indian Bible is not currently available at stores.

<p>"A man ought to desire that which is genuine instead of that which is artificial, 
and protect the natural, not pollute it to make the artificial."
<p>Okute, Teton Sioux, 1911

<p>"For the man of love is a man of truth who dwells not with false people 
and evil intentions and avoids those who speak with forked tongues and those 
who care not that they speak lies to their brothers for they live false lives 
and care not for Mother Earth nor love."
