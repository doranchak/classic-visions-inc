  <td align=left>This entry depicts a Victorian lithograph of the Battle of Wyoming in Pennsylvania in 1778.  The caption, entitled Squire Tripp and Indians, though interesting, is not factual.  Squire Tripp was not killed at the Battle of Wyoming.  Another source which I recently discovered shows the same picture, but the description is of an earlier battle at Wyoming, in 1763.  Squire Tripp was at this massacre, but again, he was not killed then.  Instead, the death of Squire Tripp occurred in 1778, six months after the Battle of Wyoming of that year, under circumstances described earlier on my web page.</td>

  <td align=left>This is a picture of a Civil War Veteran and his son-in-law, taken in the late 1800's, at the store in Indiana which they owned and operated together.  The older gentleman had started operations with another gentleman in 1875, who retired after the first two years of operation.  The son-in-law joined the operation in 1890.</td>

  <td align=left>The soldiers pictured here are Civil War veterans who participated in the battles at Vicksburg, Shiloh, Corinth, Memphis, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and the March to the Sea, serving with General Sherman.  Among those pictured here is one who, prior to enlisting, had just gotten married.   He enlisted as a private, served the entire war years, was wounded on two of his fingers in Georgia in 1863, promoted in 1865 to Lieutenant, and was present at the Grand Parade in Washington DC at the close of the war.  At the age of 27 in 1862 he stood 5'11" tall, had a dark complexion, with black eyes and black hair.  His political leanings were Democrat, and he served in the Disciples church for many years.</td>

  <td align=left>The lady pictured here was taken as a captive from her log cabin at the age of five by a band of Iroquois and adopted by them.  Raised an Indian, she married twice, both times to warriors, her last husband was chief among the Miami tribe.  She raised four children, two boys and two girls.  When she was older, she was found by two of her brothers, who offered to return her to white man's civilization, which she refused, preferring to remain among her Indian family.  Even so, she maintained good relations with her white relatives, becoming a liaison between the white settlers and the Native-American villages.  When the tribe was forcibly removed from their homelands, she and her family were allowed to remain in her adopted homeland through the aid of her white relatives.  Her family prospered and many of the surviving Miami of today are descended from her.</td>

  <td align=left>The couple pictured here had a short but happy marriage.  The girl, a cousin of Samuel Clemens, married at eighteen, the man in the picture in 1895, at the time this picture was taken.  Having already traveled west to visit her relatives in Missouri, she settled down with her new husband in Virginia where she gave birth to seven children by 1905.  An epidemic swept through the town, killing so many people the cemeteries could not handle all the bodies.  She lost three children before succumbing herself in 1907 at the age of 31.  Her husband never remarried.  An engineer on the railroad in its heyday, he was a compatriot of the engineer who wrecked the train which would be forever immortalized in the song "The Wreck of the Old 97".</td>

The document shows the amount as well as the location of the land conveyed to Sarah Wintz by Conrad Fry.  (Click on the image for a closer look)</td>
